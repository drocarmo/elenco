## Elenco
<<<<<<< HEAD

##### What Elenco is:
- A Chrome-extension (Download it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elenco/phbjhmbdcecahmckhhbdabmnhmjcpjab)).
- Lists, in Italian.
- A task helper.
- All open-sourced and open to feedback/feature requests.
- Built with Jekyll, Javascript and Sass.

##### What Elenco isn’t:
- A new way to remind yourself to brush your teeth. Maybe.
- Nothing really, possibilities are endless.

Elenco is built by Pedro Carmo (@drocarmo) and TJ Krusinski (@TJkrusinski). We're open to any feedback or feature requests.

##### How To Contribute (Make sure you have Jekyll, Ruby and Sass installed before running it on your local machine):
1. Fork it ( http://github.com/drocarmo/elenco/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -a -m 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
=======

#### A Chrome-extension that helps you stay on track with what you are currently working on.

Elenco works just like a standard todo list, and syncs all Chrome browsers your google account is logged into.
